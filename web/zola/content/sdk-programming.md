# SDK Programming

## This page is work in progress. Maybe in a few weeks?

In the meantime, please refer to my
[blog post](https://tty.neveragain.de/2024/05/20/aws-ipv6-egress.html#aws-service-endpoints-and-client-applications-aws-cli-and-sdk)
on IPv6 egress on AWS. Despite the title, it has a section called _AWS Service Endpoints and Client Applications (AWS CLI and SDK)_ that
goes into much detail.
