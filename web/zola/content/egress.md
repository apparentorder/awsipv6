# Egress

AWS services support status for IPv6 egress.

## This page is work in progress. Maybe in a few weeks?

This page will explore configuration options for IPv6 egress -- that is, for enabling AWS resources
to make outbound IPv6 connections, both to other AWS services and to external services like Docker Hub.

In the meantime, please refer to my [blog post](https://tty.neveragain.de/2024/05/20/aws-ipv6-egress.html)
on IPv6 egress on AWS. It explores the situation in detail, but isn't up to date with latest AWS service changes.
